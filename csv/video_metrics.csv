AI can only do so much. I sure hope when my channel grows so I can hire people to voice act.  Some might get confuse, but bob didn't give Manny the job he stole it from him. Since that sentience can be interpreted as Bob giving a job to Manny as well.

Decided to make a proper version of the very first ""Got a Job"" meme I've made. Since that one was just a quick test i put together. Also this video a another test to where i edit the back around to move a bit instead of bit a static image and i tired adding a radio effect to Plankton voice with audacity. 

As for the card game I'm working on I haven't done much with it since I've been more focus on making funny content. But if i get more people to join and help test it I'll probably  put more time into it.

Sorry about that.

@Chii_SaiSan made this amazing art of MD Asmongold. I wish i can do stuff like this for every video thumbnail but  would lose a lot of money quickly.

Base on a true story. I swear people don't know how to read the order display. I used to work at fast food so i know it's not hard to do. Also at the end i was trying to green screen the AC at the end but was too much work to do with my current video editor so i cop out at the end. Sorry about that.

A few of you keep asking for a follow up so here it is. At this point this video was more Fan fiction then it is a meme. Which makes me kinda of Cringe lol. I can make more video about this fan timeline,  but i want to go back back to making more ""Got a Job for you"" meme videos. Since i was starting to run out of characters for the Eleven labs  TTS I had to focus it all on this video before making another quick meme video. Might have to upgrade my subscription at this rate. BTW holding hands is the most lewd thing you can do.

When I meant no nobody important died I meant he people that are liked.

There only one person willing to help test the game with me but their time zone is completely opposite from mines and their are going back to school. So it makes it hard for the game to get tested. So if anyone interested join the discord group and when I'm available I'll show you how start into the game. As well there is a Titan Core playlist which will show how to play the game as well.

I wouldn't say it the funniest video I made, but think the concept it self is funny. I've already made two other Fast Food AC and will have more created soon. By the way the Asmondgold Meme I made isn't cannon this series.

Since my channel had recently sky rocked in subs and viewer ships I wanted to share something from my past. Before there was YouTube there was a site called Newgrounds where people post their flash animations. Seeing these animations made me want to give it a try and one of those attempts where making comical shorts of my favorite PSP game Monster Hunter Freedom. They weren't the best, but a lot of people enjoy them. 

If you aren't a fan of monster hunter or tween animation then I suggest you don't watch this. Also two parts had to be muted cause of copy righted music that was use in the past...

Sorry for the cheesy pun, but when I thought of it I had to do it. I use elevenlabs this time around for the female voices. It does a better with female voices then male. But my own Ai voices can do better once i get some voice actors. Elevenlabs is harder to do emotions and you have to sometime reaerate the text-to-speech a few times to get it the way you want which is annoying cause it waste characters that I have a limit of. 

I'll release my A.I to the public once i reach 4000 watch hours, which will make me partner with YT.

This new version of AI Ayra I've train is much better then the first. The art was made using AI as well since didn't want to take art with out permission like last time even though I credited them. 

Also if anyone is interested and believe you can do some voice work i need people to read out a script for a AC6 video I'm working on and i plan to convert those voices to sound like Walter and Ayre using the AI program.  My voice acting is terrible and isn't suited for the conversion to any of the chatters. 

To my original  viewers/subscribers don't worry I won't just be flooding my channel with these kind of videos. I plan to still make gameplay videos of Eternal and such. Once that game get new content.

While I wait I started using my free time working on my digital card game again and I finally gotten to the point where I am able to program my very own Sentinel Knight which I am calling Cold Steel Knight in this game. i hope this give people a general idea how I wanted Sentinel Knight to work in Eternal.

161,Why I Salty,1TO-SIK-jwk,Stop Eating Yourself | Eternal Card Game,2022-10-22T19:14:28Z,"I'm still taking a break form Eternal, but when I saw the new promo Vara I decided to do the oblivious thing and try to make a infinite combo deck using her. This brew is a fail it wasn't really build with any control in mind or counter to their controls. Which is why i'm only showing off the combo being played only.

Also I decided to try and remove the old intro and with something quicker and simpler so just let me know which one you prefer.

Originally I was just trying to make a TJ ramp deck for expedition with no real end goal but then I notice Skyline and all of those relics that I use for ramping so I figure to make a skyline deck and use Olyn to try and draw and buff it base on how much power I was able to ramp. This is not something to use for climbing. Just casual fun.

[Eternal Card Game],2022-06-12T04:00:30Z,"When I saw that there was a card that can give units unleash knew I had to try it with Endra, but I still had to make Endra meet the requirement of having 4 or more attack. So I decided to have her in the market and use one Arm Race or two Unexpected Arrival cards to give her the attack needed and then grab her from the market. This might be the best way to play an Endra deck. Unleash was a fun mechanic at first, but now I am getting sick of it.

My first thought was Aymar, but then they nerf here effect to make units have void bound to prevent that. But then I notice one of the newer promos Zytrom who passively gives units -1 health, which I thought was prefect substitute. As well I had to add some cards to reduce nico cost to zero, but that wasn't to hard to do. I did notice a bug with Zytrom using this combo when a unit dies it consider two units died instead of one on death trigger effects. Hopefully DWD fixes that.

Pretty much you play conclave siege and then when you deal damage while having Lynx on the field to do a infinite combo of continuing dealing 5 damage to the opponent face. I’ve recently face a player using the unblockable shadow unit when you play a card on the enemy turn it deal 1 damage but that can take much longer since it only continuing dealing 1 damage, but easier to pull off.

It fun to find out if you will either going to win by dinging them for each spell that was discarded or just straight out milling them. Most of the time it's the dinging them.

On the first day I was only able to get the combo off once, but then I decided to give another shot the next day and was able to pull it off more. Most of the clips are from the second day of playing. While the intro was recording on the first. This deck some how got me to diamond which I wasn't expecting.

The deck is base around the idea of trying to get the new promo card ""Subversion of Nautre"" to work. Originally I tired using world pyre but that didn't go so well. The next idea was to just make a Dichro Ruin Deck and just add the the new card to it. I was hesitant on doing that card I hate Dichro Ruin decks, but a viewer on the stream to tell me to try anyways so I did. This deck isn't the strongest but if your opponent isn't running aggro or relic hate then you are going to have good time.

208,Why I Salty,FZiif53zmBc,Salty Brew - Svetya Cosplay [Eternal Card Game],2022-03-16T05:04:46Z,"When I first saw the new Sveyta I thought she would go so well with the Dramatics Mask, but i didn't try to brew that deck right away cause i was looking over the other cards and already made a TJ Sveyta. This deck can be fun, but don't try to use it on the ladder it meant for causal fun only. 

Ok I have a stockpile of eternal content in the salty vault, which I try to keep as reserve incase I take a break. I decided though that I'm willing to release a third video on Friday, but only if I get 5 subs during that week. So if you or your friend haven't already why not sub together lol.

I will be taking a break from this game until the next Gold Pass is out. The game was fun, but as a YGO Boomer I'm kind of getting annoying with all of these special summoning combo that last forever and I usually can't do anything about it depending on my hand. The game was much simpler during my time.

I thought it would be very funny if was able to spam Cora ability over and over again. Turns out Quicksilver Mirror is in Expedition so decided to make a deck around the two of them. But since mirror is expensive I decided to add time for ramp. Consider it as another Elysian Hero deck but more midrage then aggro. I had a fun time with this when testing it out.

A returning player who ask me to look at their collection and make a decent deck to grind with in Expedition. This is like the first time I've done something like this usually my patrons ask for budgets deck, but never actually tell me to look and use their own cards. Anyways he had a decent amount of cards to make a aggro warcry deck. Aggro is usually the best way to go when trying to start out or returning to game. The deck did pretty well in bronze and silver rankings. I believe i had one or two matches against gold and higher which also turn out ok. Anyways Magurio hope you enjoy the deck and video.

I've haven't actually play the game since the GBA versions. They introduce so many new kinds of summoning methods and mechanics to the game so I'm total newbie to this game. I open my packs and got a few cool looking cards and wanted to see if I can make a deck with them. Turns out a few of them belong to a Tier 1 deck so I decided to focus on what resources I had to make the deck. I Wasn't able to craft a prefect copy of the deck list out there and had to use some SR as filler for the UR cards, but it turn out ok in the ladder. I'll probably won't be making a lot of content for this game, just mainly wanted to share my first attempt on PvP. I don't expect any of you to watch the whole thing.

Next best thing was to make a TJP Dino deck with a dash F so I can still use the FJ Dino. If you really wanted to you can just cut out the F from this deck, but I wanted to go this route.

Boy let me tell you it wasn't easy. I wanted to make it where you deal 25 or over damage, but that really wasn't possible. So the next best thing was to make it more of an aggro deck with units that can generate spells. Even though Ghodan is Rakano the deck it self is Praxis, but with some Justice power it in. Anyways like always this deck is fun and shouldn't be use to climb the ladder unless you feel lucky.

They changes up ruling a bit when you grab your hero where it gets Aegis which I think is prefect change because before you just pick three random effect which I didn't like. I was trying a few kind of hero decks until I found the prefect hero deck to try to climb the ladder with which was Battlemaster Kitaxius armory. I probably would of been higher in the ladder if I play this deck first, but sadly I wasted 3 runs. Oh well. They really need to make hero mode be a permeant mode or more recurring like once each month.

Anyways I notice that Calderan Cradle was added to expedition and I wanted to see if could make a deck around it. Sadly this deck didn't turn out as I wanted it to go. You would assume it would be great against aggro but I lost to aggro pretty hard in most game. As well with the buff to bull eyes Calderan Cradle will most like be destroy when played now. There's not a lot of face Aegis cards in expedtion right now. I might try to work on this again or maybe even do a throne version.

I had this idea awhile ago during set 10 using to make a even deck Endra. Where Endra is in the market  and then I use Unexpected Arrival which makes Endra become a 2 cost and I would put her in the deck using World Broker, but sadly I couldn't get it work... until now. Thanks to Xultan Ambassador. This card is better draw engine with Endra then using EHG. They really should nerf that yeti to a 3 cost.  As well with Blazing Salvo becoming a 2 cost you can now put it in an even deck and if I can also grab Endra form the market that way once i reduce her cost to 2. This deck can be alot of fun but it also has a lot of weakness.

This brew was a random request on during my twitch stream. I usually don't do request for free, but I felt like doing the exception. They ask for me to make a gunslinger deck. Gunslingers aren't a good tribe to solely male a deck around compare to Onis,Yetis, and Mandrakes but I decided to try. All I did was make a deck using gunslingers and weapons. There are no spells what so ever. In hindsight I should of at least put some seek powers, but this deck was made for the lolz.

When I made this deck I forgot Sindain's Bracers existed, but that card is better in a TP deck then FP. Cause of Xultan Ambassador. I still wish there was some 2 cost ramp cards that weren't units, but spells. The only 2 cost ramp spell is JS which is weird. Time is all about ramping.

This is my first Cold Hunt Expedition brew. It's a FJ aggro deck with a lot of relic/attachment hate. It was a fun deck to play but I didn't really try to see if I could climb the ladder with it. I love and hate aggro decks for one reason it's too easy. Sure it has it weakness like aoe wipes and other cards to slow you down but if you're opponent didn't draw any of that it a free win for you. I really don't want to get into master that way. I want to get into master using a fun combo deck or very least card with fun interactions with one another.

Like the name of the video it didn't go so well. I have no idea why they design these cards and not give it any real support for them. I try using Ixtol's Pendant to some what help trigger those cards faster, but if I don't have that relic in my starting hand then it this deck flops. Also pendant kind of makes it where you can only play one card only each turn. Would be nice having more pendants equip would reduce the cost debuff.

254,Why I Salty,H4uhD-ph8iA,Salty Failed Brew - Healthy Damage [Eternal Card Game],2021-11-07T07:23:46Z,"Was trying to make one of those decks where units health value becomes their attack value instead. It didn't go so well. Shard of Spire really needs to have a summon effect or something cause it really useless to have more then one in your starting hand. Might try to work on this deck again since they recently spoiled a spell card that works like spire, but for now all I have is this failed brew.

255,Why I Salty,TqEzm5bKrao,Bronze to Mythic Aggro [MTG Arena],2021-11-03T05:59:15Z,"Decided to take a break from my main card game Eternal since the meta was getting dull and decided to try other ccg. Since Eternal is similar to MTG I decided to try to get back into Arena, but because I'm starting from scratch and not knowing what deck to use for grinding I decided to netdeck using the untapped addon and found this white aggro deck I can make that has a 60% winrate. Personally the plan was to use this deck to get the 15 wins per day and I wasn't really expecting to climb with this deck, but it turns out I was able to reach Mythic with it only playing for like 2-3 weeks. I don't know if I'll keep playing this game or make more videos of it cause once the new set comes out for Eternal I'll most likely stop playing this game.

I ask the community and most said do nature deck and to as well check on gudecks for cheap list. I was looking at a few and seeing the win rate and decided to try this nature deck cause it didn't require me to buy and cards. It did better then I expected and was a good learning experience. My plans for this game is to only play it on Sunday during the weekend event. Still not sure if I'm going to keep playing this game especially with the announcement￼ of Eternal next set coming out. To be honest I've only started playing this game cause I was taking a break from Eternal.

So I decided to try to get into MTGA while I wait for the next set to come out for Eternal. Since I am pretty much starting from the bottom in this game I won't be  making to much content for MTGA like I do for Eternal. It would mainly be drafts and playing budget decks list I found online. I know most of you won't care for these videos and I'm expecting a lot of views, but to those who do click on this and watch I hope you enjoy the video.

I think this is the best I'm going to get. Since den is a 6 cost I decided to make this into a even deck for more card draw. Then I saw Waxing Moon and thought I could combo it with units that deal aoe damage as well it does give extra card draws. There's probably better waxing moon decks out there so unless you want to try to summon Nakova & Molot maybe try another deck.

This video is pretty much the entire stream I did recently on this game. Not sure if I will actually keep playing this game and start making content for it. I'm still trying to go through the hassle of sending my ETH (crypto currency) I made the last time I try playing to this game new digital wallet. If anyone is thinking of being nice and sending me ETH or cards I say wait until I make more videos. I felt bad the last time people were nice enough to do that and I just stop playing like a month after.

The goal is to win the game using ""Archmagister's Prophecy"" win condition. I've done a brew like this before using clockroaches, but compare to that deck this one is so much better and you're more likely to pull it off each game. I pretty much use the overloader + Diabolic Machinations combo but instead of using Pyrotech Explosion i use Inferno Dance instead. These games were recorded before the nerf to Diabolic Machinations, but i believe it can still work. So if you want to get that achievement I suggest you play this deck.

Just showing of the two games that i won showing off how i wanted the deck to work. I really wish Elham didn't have fire influence cause fire doesn't have any decent armor related cards and she was my only fire card in the deck beside 3 copies of kairos choice. I really want armory to be a thing, but i still couldn't get it to work with Valkyrie Station. They really should make the card cost 1-2 in my opinion. This video is the reason i design my custom card ""Sentinel Knight"".

313,Why I Salty,0r1CblMrN3I,Salty Brew - Death Dog [Legend of Runeterra],2021-03-05T05:00:00Z,"With the release of the new set news cards that came out for LoR i decided to give a try making a deck with Nasus since he is one of my favorite champions in LoL. I wasted alot of wild cards and shards trying to get this to work. Crafted Champions that in the end i didn't use, but i can always use them in another deck. It was a interesting learning experience. There are probability similar deck like this that are better then what i made, but i hope you guys enjoy watching.

Since i am still new to the game it will be awhile before i can start brewing my own kind of decks so if you want to help speed up my collection then why not check out my Pateron. I added a ""Donated 475 Coin ""tier. I am really not expected anyone to donate, but doesn't hurt to ask.

Where this video i'm doing eternal cards with the theme of Xulta. The goal with this series is to have one of this card actually become a real card once i gain 1,750,000 community points. I am 26.71% close to that goal. So please vote which card you like to see in the finals which will be held when i reach 100%. Last video I've only gotten 4 votes so i'm hoping to see more. I understand that you might not like any of the cards, but think of it this way the card you dislike the most might be the winner and could be come a real card. So if you don't want that to happen you may want to for another card instead.

The deck list i stole from was made by a user name Silverfuse. I had a lot of fun playing this deck and i hope you guys enjoy watching me play this deck. Also sorry about the mic being low didn't realize until after watching the recordings.

Also for those who are worry i'm will leave Eternal for this game don''t worry i will not. This game may have it fancy graphics, bigger player base,  and it supposedly best F2P grind system, but it still has some issues that makes me prefer Eternal over it.

I really don't know if what i design was something that has be done by other people or not, but i was just trying to make him as similar as possible to his LoL counter part. I wonder how he will actually be in the game. For those LoR players who are watching this please don't be to harsh on these designs It my first time doing LoR cards.

Also sorry for my messy hair not being able to go to a barber due to covid sucks...

It been a while since i done one of these videos for many reasons, but we will see how it goes this time. 

Quick warning i'm mainly going to be doing videos of this game playing Gauntlet/Arena mode and any constructed videos i do will be on feature decks. So before any Mythgard player subscribes to this channel i might only do a Mythgard video every other week. I am mainly a Eternal content creator, but it can get tiring playing the same game over again.

The goal with this series is to have one of this card actually become a real card once i gain 1,750,000 community points. I am 26.71% close to that goal. So please vote which card you like to see in the finals which will be held when i reach 100%. Last video I've only gotten 4 votes so i'm hoping to see more. I understand that you might not like any of the cards, but think of it this way the card you dislike the most might be the winner and could be come a real card. So if you don't want that to happen you may want to for another card instead.

So if you want one of my custom cards to become a reality sooner then please join me when i stream on Twitch at 9:00 EST Latest on Sunday every week. Unless something comes up like school work or something.

I discover it while playing expedition where the opponent was playing a deck like this and i decided to try and copy what they did base on how that game went (I don't look up deck list and copy). When the card ""Pyrotech Explosion"" was first spoiler i try thinking of ideas on what to do, but i couldn't think of any.  When ""Diabolic Machinations"" was also spoiler i figure it as a useless card and didn't really think how well it could work with Overloader. I got to say it a pretty powerful combo, which i believe should be some what nerfed. I recently learn that there is a better version of this deck that is FSP so i wouldn't recommend using my deck.

Anyway this is my attempt on a faction less deck. It turn out a lot better then i expected, but i wouldn't recommend this deck for climbing.

I originally started doing this project to give people a free alternate to Hearthstone where you can have all the cards to play. As well i wanted to give it more customization with the classes, by getting rid of them and using the MTG/Eternal color/faction system where you can make something like a warrior+mage or even something more. I dream one day to start a kickstarter and try to make it to a real free to play card game.

The help i am mainly looking for is card design, balancing, and play testers. Artists and Writers would be nice, but  I can't afford to play anyone at the moment. If i get more patrons on pateron then i might be able too. So if you are interested why not join my discord and say hi in the #project_champion.

I thought i might do so well since throne as more control and other aggro hate cards, but it turn out to be a lot of fun. It even got me to master in two days. So you might be able to climb to master with if you play enough games with it. So sorry about the very big throne symbol in the corner i accidentally had it say Expedition when recording so i had to cover it lol.

Who ask me to improve this cheap aggro feln deck made by RayDimir. I personally didn't see anything wrong with the deck, but can't say no to a Patron request. He also told me that i could only use legendary cards form campaigns which made it hard cause those set didn't really have any legendary cards what would work well with this deck so i didn't add any. In the end i kind of made the deck into something else, but he still like it so we're good lol.

Since mono decks (mainly shadow) are doing decently well thanks to Prism Golem.  When i was building my mono deck i decided to focus on units with aegis in order to counter mono shadow with all of their kill cards. As well equipping Worldshaper's Staff to a aegis unit is a safer potion since they won't get kill by spells right away. Had a lot of fun with this deck and it might actually be mono shadow rival.

The reason i went with clockroaches was when you play one they buff the other roaches in your hand and deck so they will rarely have the same stats, but the next challege was to draw them in the first place, but then i came up with the genius idea of having the roach in the market and garbing with with market cards. Turn out way better then expected, but it was still hard to win with Archmagister's Prophecy because people would surrender before i got that far. Again thank you Bava for becoming my patron and making me come up with this fun deck.

Today brew is neither a Throne or Expedition deck, but an event deck. Which is the Heroic Return event (If you had play MTG commander it plays something like that). I love this event and every time it comes out I've always spend my gold on it and i really i wish it was turn into a real game mode. I wouldn't even care if it didn't had rank. each time I've always try to make a deck around Stella in a Winchest (FTJ) Gunslinger deck, but this time i decided to try Rakano (FJ) instead. Which lead to better results. Even got 7 wins in one of my runs.

I fine the game fun to play, but it not something i would recommend to someone who is F2P only. They call this game ""play-to-earn"" meaning you can  actually make some money playing this game by crafting  together two of the same grey cards  into a red card which you can sell for Ethereum(it like a bitcoin) which can be turn into real money. But for now if you want to build a collection you need to buy the cards which are sold on a few sites. Personally i', going to see how far i can get by not spending any money. Wish me luck.

Wasn't actually planning on making a brew when i was streaming, but it just happen at the end. As you can tell by the tittle it's another flash fire stranger deck, but for throne this time. I decided to brew this after getting fed up with climbing and it turns out it actually help me climb to Diamond 1. Even though i was able to climb to Diamond 1 not sure i would recommend it it. Also unlike the expedition version i didn't add the ""EXPLOSION!"" audio.

Warring: Turns out the in game audio wasn't recorded and the mic was plug out for the first two games.  Wish someone in my stream notice and tell me, but oh well.  Sorry Mr Claw.

Also just letting people know the first 5 people to sign up for the Small or Medium Size Fries Tiers will be automatic have their Tier upgrade to Large, but still only having to pay for the Small or Medium prices.

Edit: 4 spots left for a free upgrade to large size fries.

Before the release and spoiler of Milo i was trying to make a fire bomb deck that work around ""Touch of Resilience"" and ""Messenger Hawk"" which didn't go well. Then i thought the new  Milo would actually make it work, but i was wrong. So With the Suggestion form Air Heater on my twitch stream i went with a Praxis deck that would use the ""Amaran  Stinger"" and ""Unexpected Results"" combo. I sort of had this idea before, but once he mention the idea i decided to give it a shot. I had alot of fun with this deck and you might be able to climb with it.

What great about these deck that you don't have to own any of the cards to play them. i find this to be a brilliant idea since it helps newer player getting into the game. To be honest those stater decks aren't any good for PvP only good in PvE. Having something like this is great and i wish other card games did the same. So i decided to make a video showing of one of the feature deck this week call ""Slippery Shinobis"".  I hope i get a big enough collection to start making videos of decks that i make in the future.

I actually thought people would hate my videos. It’s good to see that I was wrong. 

As well people keep trying to add me on eternal, but I’m starting to run out of room so what I decided to do was to make a discord room where you want to chat and ask me anything. As well if you have a suggestion for a future video i even made a room where you can post your own idea for let fix it video and if i like your idea I will show it in the next video and credit it you for it. I’ll put a link in the descriptions below.

I hope I can continue to make more eternal and other digital card game related content that people can enjoy and to see my channel grow even more. Again l like to thank you all for watching my videos and without you guys i’m just a salty nobody.

See you guys in the next video.
