785,SQOcCaiXk6k,"RI0T here, the deck salty played is what I believe to be the strongest deck in titan core by a large gap. In fact, it used to be much stronger thanks to a certain overpowered hero passive which skyrocketed the deck to undefeated levels of strength, however that passive has long since been removed. Still, yellow/white swarm is still the strongest deck because it had a few buffs (the addition of 8 mana board buff) and one of it's strongest cards still being available, ultra guardian. Ultra guardian is one the strongest cards in titan core, being a 1/4 with ward already means it is difficult to remove early on in addition to it's ability to gain forcefield after playing 2 units (easily achieved even with 1 mana thanks to recruitment). This in combination with yellows already powerful aggro swarming solidifies it's place in the tier 0 spot.

But let me stop talking about salty's deck and start with mine: first with evolve ""midrange""
The deck revolves around the evolve mechanic and how it's able to become a solid toolbox in many situations. The main dino, Alpha Zirak, is incredible not only as a standalone powerhouse but also as an enabler for all of your other dinosaurs. Alpha Zirak is so essential to this deck that I mulligan every hand that doesn't contain it, the deck is also designed to play Alpha Zirak with all the necessary keywords (rush, leech, swipe, force field) on turns 4-5 consistently to help swing boards in your favour and overwhelm your opponent with sheer value.

Second deck is in fact not a y/w swarm deck but rather a combo deck. I haven't chosen the correct color ratio and the deck is pretty reliant on pieces so i can't say much about it especially since I'd like to keep it a secret (maybe I'll pull it off and you'll see it in a video).

Lastly is the deck I think can have a positive winrate against y/w swarm: r/w control (yes white is a verry good color.)
The large armour gain paired with powerful attack buffs allow this deck to deal with threats through forced combat and with armored rampage still being the strongest removal card (and prowess enabler), y/w is going to struggle against it but not an impossible match up.

The first change that I'm working on is replacing ixtol and the rat with more copies of unraveller and snapyx. You could also replace borderscout and keep the rats if you suspect more aggro

Vikrum is a fantastic tool for stealing card and is still useful even without spire. You could replace him by dizo but imo dizo is just a strictly worse vikrum. 

Cargo could get replaced by seek power depending if you want more value or just guarantee the power draw. Same goes for trail maker. You could go for another fix or max power option (or even cut it and add another good cards) 

Saloon massacre is a really underestimated card imo as it allows for good early clear (virtually a 4 damage aoe for 2) it also has the advantage to bypass regeneration but you could replace it for other things like other aoe. 

In the base version I used to play Riva and the deck was a four color. If you want to play it that much I'm working on a version of it that is cutting the primal part. (blue is honestly the less good color as both yellow and purple are not only obligatory for the deck but it also offers fantastic card suck as unraveller snapyx and arach) you could also try the four colors but the reason I cut Riva was because you would find that running a 4 color spire deck is really not easy with the influence cost (still possible tho) 

Feel free to come back and ask questions if you want. I hope more people can get into spire as they make unplayable cards surprisingly good (honorable mention to archive curator which is really good in this deck to tempo and control)",Xanhras,2022-03-12T16:16:09Z,UgzjVETQfJzlOvR2im94AaABAg,UgzjVETQfJzlOvR2im94AaABAg.9ZQl44GsOaC9ZU9Q-jgTYv

Maybe I‚Äôll make some new ones, but if you want to find some budgets decks ok your own then check on eternalwarcry. 

As for an easier way of gaining new cards. There really no real way of doing that. Unless you are willing to spend money on bundles. If you haven‚Äôt done so yet you should make and link a twitch account to your eternal account and afk watch other eternal streamers you will get cards by doing that.

World bearer is a much better fit especially as you are running killer, and would probably play that over the mandrake.

totemite over powered if it just said decay play this card from the void and transform it into a 2/2 totem duo with decay and for extra flavor (as its a trio) and then the totem duo said play it from the void and transform it into a 1/1 totem solo with decay. 
focus magic - tutor spell - not bad maybe a bit cheap for what it does, maybe just 1 of the choices
shavkas flute -idea of a weapon for a specific tribe is interesting not sure about that one though
the site is interesting - and the change to the flavor text is probably correct

1679,BfEZaKLsInk,"Wealth Welp - I like the card, it's more of a combo that you are trying to set up but that still requires you to attack. Also you are passing on drawing cards for more damage later, so it creates  interesting choices. It gets my vote.

Gun Point - I don't like cards that give choice to an opponent. I don't want to see more cards like this in the game. It's quite a bad card power-wise as well, deal 4 to face for 3 is not great at all. Should definitely not be a Rare I think.

D'Angolo Pistol - I like this one, Quickdraw & Reckless is interesting but I find the effect a bit confusing. I don't see how it would translate in game. You draw the card, get to see it then it gets plundered. That would feel weird I guess, to have a card automatically transform in your hand. But other than that it's a cool concept, maybe it could be phrased more elegantly

Treasure Map - I don't like the plunder being a Fate effect. If I draw 2 in my opening hand, I have to plunder twice before the game has even started. It's possibly too strong but mainly too long and boring for the other player. Why not having the plunder effect while playing it? I think that it would make a fine card.

One question - do you feel that these 100 packs were worth the 60 hour wait?",Tatiana Searle,2020-07-14T11:10:26Z,UgyUq_0qGsd2lsNaBnR4AaABAg,0

He comes with 3 charges so that means you can 3x deal 2 damage to minions in opposing 3 lanes, that means dealing 6 damage total to 3 minions in front of it the same turn you play it. You could also do 2 damage to 3 minions in front + 4 scoped damage to any other minion on the field.

On the contest for feature deck submission, Rhino makes clear all the restrictions for the list, there's a rare and a mythic limitation. And usually these decks are built to showcase a theme or a mechanic.
So you will still do very better doing your own decks, with no rarity limitation.
In bronze and silver you can do fairly well with the feature decks. But mid-Gold and up you will have a harder time.

For this deck I would see something that masivly play units and somehow allow to change their stats. So to play units maybe Bastion Garnison or Valkiria station or totemites with Cheering section and tota circle + some kind of draw from graveyard or maybe something like Kimi (?). For me seems like a unachivable task :D

1883,MiXwi99hbj8,"My only complaint was that it seemed like you were making quite a lot of misplays, possibly from forgetting a certain part of the card- the fact that all of your units need to be at different attack/health combinations.
In the second-to-last game, for example, you seemed super hyped over almost getting the combo off, but you just played all of the clockroaches by hand order instead of paying attention to their statlines and, for example, playing the roaches from weakest to strongest to make sure no clockroaches ever had identical statlines, and then you targeted the explorer with the Prophecy instead of targeting, for example, the 3/3 or 6/6 Clockroaches to break up identical statlines. If you *had* gotten a full board it would've instantly disappointed you with the fact that it didn't fit the Prophecy's requirements, requiring several turns to fix the board and allowing the opponent time to respond.",Lunamann,2020-07-14T06:39:25Z,Ugx-bIeuEfd2vubLZaV4AaABAg,0

1887,MiXwi99hbj8,"Nice quest hunting and deck. Just in case you didn't realise that it was a thing at time stamp 11:15 when the opponent plays Avigraft. If want to even more ""feel so smart"" when using Fearless Crescendo, you can wait until the relic targets the unit - and is usually better to do so, and give it flying after it has selected the unit for removal, so that they cant target a different ground unit and still get value from the Avigraft. 
Also I have to agree the winning animation when you achieve the win con is rather lack lustre and disappointing and would like it to have a bit more pop.
I got this achievement purely by luck using a throne room & mother of skies, flyers deck as the free units throne gives and the multiple flyers mother can give made it so I could have lots of units with different defences  Don't know how long but it wasn't very long as I only played the deck for under 2 hrs.",taylormadetactics,2020-06-01T03:19:21Z,Ugwmp17jrwrcJEsY2vt4AaABAg,0

But they gave up on Mentor anyway,  so whatever I guess.

2055,3Ln7ZodueVs,"the difference here is that smugglers exist. Yes Merchants would see play if there were no other way to access the market.

Combine smugglers with Bargian and the new market spells (swap a card of X cost) and I don't see merchants seeing any play unless you want more than 8 smugglers, and even then only if the merchant you want is one of the better ones.


Any deck that relies on 3+1 market (reanimator, for example) doesn't exist after this patch. Any deck which was already using a black market will continue to use smugglers an overwhelming amount of the time (and won't play merchants before their 8 smugglers), and decks that used 3+1 markets in the past but can adapt to a black market will...and they'll use smugglers.",Timothy E.,2020-03-09T22:54:02Z,UgxPIG1moBq2-j0gzoZ4AaABAg,UgxPIG1moBq2-j0gzoZ4AaABAg.95u9i_tOCZv96-SGqwiNdv

2120,v5qfxxm4WNc,"Personally, I also had a similar idea of not having power cards and just using unwanted cards as power, with being able to select one influence from the unwanted card's factions.

Your idea of moving it to a pool that can be interacted with is something I did not think of.  However, I did think of a keyword (Channel) that triggers when a card is played as power (e.g. Channel: Scout) which I gave to mono-faction cards, since they did not give you a choice of influence when played.

This does make card selection and influence/power fixing weaker, but I like the fact that now you constantly had to choose which card was not useful in your current situation so it could be used as power.

A small point of play that I've noticed you have a habit of doing - is just putting your seek power straight into the market instead of playing it first thinning your deck by -1 and then playing or putting the power as needed in the market instead - it might not seem like much and most of the time has not made much difference - but sometimes it has - just like to see a good player making correct plays not only for themselves but also for anyone watching.",taylormadetactics,2020-01-07T06:15:14Z,Ugw9CycUt7_tRW6q3Up4AaABAg,0

2140,Zv1NmfdhYPA,"I had an old combrei deck that was something similar idea to this - using shush and desert marshal to silence problem units and the sword of unity to keep my life total high and protect my stuff, and just upped the number of copies I played of each to counter the endra deck too, as I am also sick of playing against it. .
Although I did forget about aamrils choice and might try and make room for one or two also. But the deck has already got a 100% record vs endra so maybe not.

bear in mind its a slightly older list and I have just added more marshalls and shush and is by no means optimal but its proved good enough vs endra so far",taylormadetactics,2020-01-03T08:14:36Z,Ugwg11n7EWr5rZ6Hog54AaABAg,0
